        <p>
            Hello, my name is Mohammad and I am a computer science major. This will be my last semester here at Lewis before I graduate in December. I am big into 
            video games and watching anime. I mostly play computer games, although I did grow up playing playstation. I watch anime which is basically Japanese 
            cartoons, but more serious ones with life lessons in them. Anime will sometimes have some deep meaning within a character that will make you wonder 
            if they are really the bad guys. I am the youngest of 5. I have 3 older brothers and an older sister. I currently work with one of my brothers at his 
            tobacco shop.

        <h3 class="header">What I hope to learn from this class</h3>
        <p>
            What I really want to learn from this class is node.js. I have already taken a class with you where we made html and css web pages, but never got in depth 
            with node.js. I want to learn how to make a fully functioning website that you can host from your computer. All html applications I have done were hosted 
            in azure.

        <h5 class="header">My Favorite Hobby</h5>
        <p>
            My favorite hobby would have to be playing video games. Video games can cover all sorts of avenues from adventure, to problem solving, to team work, etc. 
            Anything that has a competitive aspect to it will get me hooked. I play to have fun first, but also to get better at the game and having the competitive 
            aspect of it will make you better. The game that I have played the most is called Dota 2. The category is called moba which stands for massive online 
            battle arena. It is a 5vs5 online game and you fight the other team to level up and get stronger and the way to win is to destroy the enemies base. I can 
            also lose myself in adventure/story games. Some games will make you forget what is happening outside and just focus on you and the game you are playing.
        </p>

            Fun Fact: Last year during the pandemic I started to make custom shirts and sweaters. Basically if you have an image or idea that you want on some clothing
            I can do it. I have made myself multiple shirts and made sweaters for my friends. The way I do it is called HTV, or heat transfer vinyl. You get a machine
            to cut out your image/idea and you heat it onto a shirt or sweater with a press (basically a big ironing machine).
